Windows installer is available under releases

In theory, as an Electron program it should work on Linux and MacOS

To build for another platform (Requires NodeJS):

- Download/clone the directory
- Open an administrator terminal and navigate to the directory
- Run 'npm i' to get dependencies
- Run 'npm build' and wait

To run the development version, follow the same steps but do 'npm run dev' instead of the last step.

Thanks for checking out my project.
